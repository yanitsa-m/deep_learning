    "## Cross entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "-  A simple way to understand cross entropy is to consider having a set of events and set of probabilities, and posing the question - how likely is it that these events happened based on these probabilities? If the answer is very likely, then the cross entropy is *small* , otherwise it is large.\n",
    "-  To calculate cross entropy, we take the sum of the negatives of the logarithms of the probabilities.\n",
    "-  Using the sum of logarithms allows us to avoid taking the product of probabilities which could result in a very small quanitity.\n",
    "-  Since the log of a number between 0 and 1 (since we are using only these kinds of values) is always negative, we in turn have take the negative of the log of the probability.\n",
    "-  A low cross entropy indicates a good model - this is because a good model gives a high probability, but we are actually taking the negative log of that high number which results in a small number!\n",
    "-  This also applies to the individual points, correctly classified points will have smaller values or errors.\n",
    "-  The cross entropy can be extended for a multi class problem as well."
