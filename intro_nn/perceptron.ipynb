    "## Perceptron \n",
    "\n",
    "-  The perceptron is the building block for a neural network and this is a basic example for binary classification problem.\n",
    "-  Given a set of inputs represented by X, a set of target values represented by y, a set of weights W, biases b, and finally the parameter of the learning rate (alpha), the perceptron algorithm goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly initialize weights w_1...w_n, and b which gives the equation Wx+b\n",
    "2. For very misclassified point, (x_1...x_n): <br />\n",
    "    2.1 if the prediction is 0, for i to n: we change w_i to w_i+alpha * x_i and change b to b+alpha <br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 if the prediction is 1, for i to n: we change w_i to w_i-alpha * x_i and change b to b-alpha\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Repeat until convergence (no more errors, number of iterations, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  After each update, we should expect the line to move closer to the misclassified point, and we get closer to the goal of perfectly separating our two classes with a linear decision boundary.\n",
    "-  In this example, we are using a step function for the activation function at the output layer. The linear combination of the input values, weights and bias are fed into the output layer; there the step function is applied to this value and returns only two types of output values for the final output: 0 or 1."
